=== Hot Dog/ No Hot Dog ===

Perform Image Classification and document your
  - Steps,
  - Results, and 
  - Insights
in a report (“Laborbericht”) using
  - Text
  - Code fragments (if applicable), and 
  - Screenshots!

The report, including figures (screenshots, etc.), might be around 2-4 pages (A4 format). Keep it short and to the point! Please upload the report as a PDF file when done. Please do not upload any additional files, everything should be in the report!

(1) Make yourself familiar with Teachable Machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) for Image Classification.

(2) Train your own model. You might use the hot-dog-no-hot-dog dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog), any other dataset or – recommended for your own best learning experience – a collection of your own photos (e.g., collect images from a topic from Google Image Search). 

(3) Show and discuss results, especially limitations or what might have surprised you. For example: What happens if you apply the trained model on an image which shows an object not included in the training-dataset (e.g., your face). What is the most crucial/ time consuming step when training a model? Etc.

STAY CURIOUS and HAVE FUN!
